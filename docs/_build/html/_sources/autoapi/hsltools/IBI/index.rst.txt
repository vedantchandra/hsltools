Module Contents
---------------


.. function:: rmssd(signal)

   Returns the Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences (RMSSD) of the IBI signal.

   :param signal: Array containing numbers whose RMSSD is desired.
   :type signal: array-like

   :returns: Returns the RMSSD of the signal.
   :rtype: ndarray


.. function:: ibi_passbands(signal)

   Returns an array containing the very low frequency, low frequency, and high frequency
   passbands of the IBI signal (see eda.eda_passbands).

   :param signal: Array containing numbers whose frequency passbands are desired.
   :type signal: array-like

   :returns: Returns array containing frequency passbands [vlf_integral, lf_integral, hf_integral]

             vlf_integral - very low frequency, 0.0033-0.04 Hz
             lf_integral - low frequency, 0.04-0.15 Hz
             hf_integral - high frequency, 0.15-0.4 Hz
   :rtype: array-like


.. function:: ibi_lfhf(signal)

   Returns the ratio of low frequency passbands to high frequency passbands of the IBI signal
   (see IBI_passbands).

   :param signal: Array containing numbers whose ratio between low and high frequency passbands is desired.
   :type signal: array-like

   :returns: Returns the ratio of low frequency passbands to high frequency passbands of the signal.
   :rtype: float


.. function:: ibi_all_features(signal)

   Returns all of the IBI features of the IBI signal in the form of a labeled data frame (rmssd, ibi_lf/hf).

   :param signal: Array containing numbers whose IBI features are desired.
   :type signal: array-like

   :returns: Returns a data frame of all the EDA features with the column headings [ibi_rmssd,
             ibi_lf/hf]

             ibi_rmssd - see rmssd
             ibi_lf/hf - see ibi_lfhf
   :rtype: DataFrame
