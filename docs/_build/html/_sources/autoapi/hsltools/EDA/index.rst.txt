.. function:: mean_firstdiff(signal)

   Returns the mean first difference of the EDA signal.

   The first difference in perturbed epochs is expected to be higher in magnitude than those at
   rest due to the orienting responses in active states [1]. Feature extraction from the first and
   second differences of the EDA signal can be used to study the manifestation of psychological
   stress [2].

   :param signal: Array containing numbers whose standard deviation of the first differences is desired.
   :type signal: array-like

   :returns: Returns the standard deviation of the signal's first differences.
   :rtype: ndarray


.. function:: mean_seconddiff(signal)

   Returns the mean second difference of the EDA signal (see mean_firstdiff).

   :param signal: Array containing numbers whose mean second difference is desired.
   :type signal: array-like

   :returns: Returns the mean value of the signal's second differences.
   :rtype: ndarray


.. function:: std_seconddiff(signal)

   Returns the standard deviation of the EDA signal's second difference (see mean_firstdiff).

   :param signal: Array containing numbers whose standard deviation of the second differences is desired.
   :type signal: array-like

   :returns: Returns the standard deviation of the signal's second differences.
   :rtype: ndarray


.. function:: find_peaks(signal)

   Returns the peaks of the EDA signal and returns the minima between the peaks.

   A median filter (with a window size of 31) is first applied to reduce noise. Peaks of the orienting
   response are calculated using peak prominence and distance between responses as
   constraints to further avoid noise. The minima between peaks is also calculated.

   :param signal: Array containing numbers whose peaks are desired.
   :type signal: array-like

   :returns: Returns the indices of peaks in the signal.
             Returns minima between the peaks.
   :rtype: (ndarray, ndarray)


.. function:: orienting_features(signal)

   Returns an array containing features of orienting response of the EDA signal as calculated in
   Healy and Picard (number of onsets, sum of onsets, sum of peaks, difference between sum of
   onsets and peaks, sum of area under response curve, sum of orienting response duration,
   mean of orienting response duration, mean amplitude of peaks, total amplitude of peaks).

   An orienting response is a multisystem reaction evoked by exposure to a novel stimulus [1].
   One part of the physiological response is the ionic filling of sweat glands in the skin due to the
   activation of the sympathetic nervous system [2]. This leads to a sudden rise in skin
   conductance, as well as an automatic shift of attentional resources to the stimulus [3].

   :param signal: Array containing numbers whose orienting response features are desired.
   :type signal: array-like

   :returns: Returns an array of orienting response features of the signal [num_onsets, sum_onsets, sum_peaks,
             sum_difference, sum_areas, sum_od, mean_od, mean_amp, total_amp].

             total_amp - the total amplitude of the peaks Σ(Xpeak+Xonset)/2 (see find_peaks)
   :rtype: array-like


.. function:: eda_passbands(signal)

   Returns an array containing the very low frequency, low frequency, and high frequency
   passbands of the EDA signal.

   EDA is strongly correlated to sweat production, so its power spectral density (PSD) can be used
   to measure arousal of the sympathetic nervous system in isolation [1]. Low frequency (LF)
   changes derive from the influence of the cardiac sympathetic nerves [3], so the same LF
   passband was used for IBI and EDA. The PSD was approximated using a periodogram, and the
   integral for each passband was calculated using composite trapezoidal integration.
