.. function:: signal_statistics(signal)

   Returns an array containing basic statistics of the signal (mean, standard deviation, skewness,
   kurtosis, maximum, minimum, interquartile range, variation, entropy, scaled correlation time).

   :param signal: Array containing numbers whose basic statistics are desired.
   :type signal: array-like

   :returns: Returns array of basic statistics [mean, std, skewness, kurtosis, maximum, minimum, iqr,
             variation, entropy, corrtime].

             mean - mean of the signal
             std - standard deviation of the signal
             skewness - imbalance and asymmetry from the mean computed as the Fisher-Pearson coefficient of skewness
             kurtosis - sharpness of the peak of a frequency-distribution curve
             maximum - maximum value of the signal
             minimum - minimum value of the signal
             iqr - interquartile range, statistical dispersion as the diffrence betwen the upper and lower quartiles
             variation - ratio of the biased standard deviation to the mean
             entropy - measure of uncertainty using Shannon entropy
             corrtime - see scaled_correlation_time
   :rtype: ndarray


.. function:: ss_dataframe(signal)

   Returns signal_statistics of the signal in the form of a labeled data frame.

   :param signal: Array containing numbers whose basic statistics are desired.
   :type signal: array-like

   :returns: Returns a data frame of basic statistics with column headings [mean, std, skewness, kurtosis,
             maximum, minimum, iqr, variation, entropy, corrtime] (see signal_statistics).
   :rtype: DataFrame


.. function:: scaled_correlation_time(signal1, signal2)

   Returns the scaled correlation time of the signal.

   :param signal1: Array containing numbers whose correlation time is desired.
   :type signal1: array-like
   :param signal2: Array containing numbers whose correlation time is desired.
   :type signal2: array-like

   :returns: Returns the scaled correlation time of the signals.
   :rtype: ndarray of ints
